# Scroll Area

Custom styled, cross-browser scrollable area using native functionality.

## Basic Example

```python demo
rx.scroll_area(
    rx.flex(
        rx.text(
            """Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and
        aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense “legible” and “readable”
        are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but
        related concepts.""",
        ),
        rx.text(
            """Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be
        distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as “the

        sizes, this is a problem of legibility.""",
        ),
        rx.text(
            """Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to
        select the correct font to use. Brush Script is an example of a font

        only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces legibility.""",
        ),
        direction="column",
        spacing="4",
    ),
    type="always",
    scrollbars="vertical",
    style={"height": 180},

)

```

## Control the scrollable axes

Use the `scrollbars` prop to limit scrollable axes. This prop can take values `"vertical" | "horizontal" | "both"`.

## Setting the type of the Scrollbars

The `type` prop describes the nature of scrollbar visibility.

`auto` means that scrollbars are visible when content is overflowing on the corresponding orientation.

`always` means that scrollbars are always visible regardless of whether the content is overflowing.

`scroll` means that scrollbars are visible when the user is scrolling along its corresponding orientation.

`hover` when the user is scrolling along its corresponding orientation and when the user is hovering over the scroll area.
